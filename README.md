# Image Classification using SVM

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification. The dataset used contains images of cats and dogs, divided into training and testing sets. The aim is to classify the images correctly using SVM.

## Project Structure

- `train/`: Contains the training images of cats and dogs.
- `test/`: Contains the testing images of cats and dogs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `svm_classification.py`: The main script for training and testing the SVM classifier.

## Requirements

To install the required packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Ensure that you have the correct directory structure:

PROGIDY_ML_03/
├── train/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
├── test/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
├── requirements.txt
└── svm_classification.py
Navigate to the project directory:

cd PROGIDY_ML_03
Run the SVM classification script:

python svm_classification.py
The script will output the accuracy of the classifier on the test set.

Results
The accuracy of the SVM classifier on the test set is displayed after running the script.
